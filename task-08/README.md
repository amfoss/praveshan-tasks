# Pokémon Rescue

Pokémon Rescue: Professor Oak's ultimate Pokémon research app for trainers worldwide!

Professor Oak has provided all the information you'll need to rebuild his app. He's also been thoughtful enough to capture a recording of what the app looked like before the accident. Complete all the three stages he's mentioned to complete this task successfully.

###  Stage 1 :-
    - Fetch the data from from the API.
    - Display the name, official artwork (image), abilities, types and stats when queried with the name of a Pokémon. 
    - Add the background provided in assets.

###  Stage 2:-
    - Capture the Pokémon i.e. download the image.

###  Stage 3:-
    - Display all the Pokémon captured with their respective names using a new window

**Feel free to get creative and customize the GUI to make your app stand out.**
