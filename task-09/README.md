# GeoQuest

In the covert world of high-stakes espionage, you, codename
CartoGrapher is recruited into a secret organization with a mission
to build a unique map application.

Armed with Google\'s Flutter framework for Android and iOS, and
harnessing the power of OpenStreetMap, a formidable open-source tool
at your disposal, your mission, should you choose to
accept it, is to create an ingenious app that
allows agents to drop pins on critical locations they intend to
infiltrate, while seamlessly displaying the distance and time required
for each covert operation.

Flutter is like a digital acrobat, performing gravity-defying stunts
with its smooth animations and transitions that make your UI come alive!
With Flutter, it\'s a carnival of widgets, where every carnival
booth offers a unique and interactive experience.

With your coding prowess, this covert travel app will be a vital tool
for the organization\'s agents as they embark on top-secret assignments
across the world, navigating with precision and speed through
the shadows of espionage.

## The app should have the following features:
* Drop a pin on the map.
* Display the distance and the time it takes to reach the pinned location from the current location.
