# amFOSS Task - 2 
## **Begin your journey with Linux and Git**😎

As you already installed Ubuntu, it’s time to learn some commonly used terminal commands and learn about  Git commands, so get your weapons loaded.
> Note: For all the tasks given below you should be strictly implemented using ubuntu terminal commands only.

You need to find a ***location coordinate 🚩 of a place in the globe*** by answering the below simple questions step by step😉.

1. First, you need to create a directory and name it ```Coordinates-Location``` and go into that directory.
2. Now create a Directory called ```North``` and go into it, and implement the following step by step.
    - **i.** Create a file called ```NDegree.txt``` and answer the following question.
        - **a.** Find the discriminant of 2x^2-5x+2=0?
        - **b.** Add a degree(°) symbol to ***(a)*** (**Eg:** x°).
        - **c.** Now store the value of ***(b)*** in ```NDegree.txt```.
    - **ii.** Create a file called ```NMinutes.txt``` and answer the following questions.
        - **a.** What is the only prime number to end with the digit 5?
        - **b.** Add single quote(‘) to ***(a)*** (**Eg:** y’).
        - **c.** Now store the value of ***(b)*** in ```NMinutes.txt```.
    - **iii.** Create a file called ```NSeconds.txt``` and answer the following questions.
        - **a.** what is the largest even number that can not be written as the sum of two odd composite numbers?
        - **b.** Add “0.1” value to the value of ***(a)***.
        - **c.** Add Double quote(“) to ***(b)*** (**Eg:** Z’’).
        - **d.** Now store the value of ***(c)*** in ```NSeconds.txt```.
    - **iv.** Make a file ```NorthCoordinate.txt``` formed from the combination of the files you had created in the above steps-***(i)***,***(ii)***,***(iii)***.
    - **v.** Copy the ```NorthCoordinate.txt``` to the ```Coordinate-Location``` directory and rename it as ```North.txt``` and delete the file created in step-***(iv)***.
3. Keep going you have just completed finding half of the Location Coordinate🙌, now it's time to find the remaining half😀. Now again go to the ```Coordinates-Location``` directory.
4. Create a Directory called ```East``` go into it, and again implement the following step by step.
    - **i.** Create a file called ```EDegree.txt``` and answer the following question.
        - **a.** what is the atomic number of Osmium?
        - **b.** Add a degree(°) symbol to ***(a)*** (**Eg:** x°).
        - **c.** Now store the value of ***(b)*** in ```EDegree.txt```.
    - **ii.** Create a file called ```EMinutes.txt``` and answer the following question.
        - **a.** what is the highest score in a hand of cribbage game?
        - **b.** Add single quote(‘) to ***(a)*** (**Eg:** y’).
        - **c.** Now store the value of **(b)** in ```EMinutes.txt```.
    - **iii.** Create a file called ```ESeconds.txt``` and answer the following question.
        - **a.** What is the minimum age for united states senators?
        - **b.** Add “0.8” value to the value of ***(a)***.
        - **c.** Add Double quote(“) to ***(b)*** (**Eg:** Z’’).
        - **d.** Now store the value of ***(c)*** in ```ESeconds.txt```.
    - **iv.** Make a file called ```EastCoordinate.txt``` formed from the combination of files you created in the above steps-***(i)***,***(ii)***,***(iii)***
    - **v.** Copy the ```EastCoordinate.txt``` to the ```Coordinate-Location``` directory and rename it as ```East.txt``` and delete the file created in step-***(iv)***.
5. Make a file called ```Location-Coordinate.txt``` formed from the combination of ```North.txt``` and ```East.txt``` files in the ```Coordinate-Location``` directory. 
6. Now convert the values in the ```Location-Coordinates.txt``` according to the DMS format of GPS Coordinates, thats it you got the location coordintates of a place🙌. 
7. It's time to place the final coordinate in Google Maps and take a screenshot of the location where it is pointing in the maps 🚩.
8. Create a ```SOLUTION.md``` file in the ```Coordinates-Location``` directory and write detailed terminal commands 👨‍💻 which you have used in each steps except ***step-6***  and at the last keep the Screenshot image of the map and also write the Git terminal commands that you will use to push all these work to your GitHub repository.
9. Finally push it to the amFOSS task-02 folder of your amFOSS Tasks repo using the ```git push``` command😏.
